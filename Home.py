Having been led, as we believe, by the Spirit of God to receive the Lord Jesus 
Christ as our Savior; and on the profession of our faith, having been baptized in the 
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, we do now in the 
presence of God, angels and this assembly, most solemnly and joyfully enter into 
covenant with one another, as one body in Christ.

We engage therefore, by the aid of the Holy Spirit, to walk together in Christian 
love; to strive for the advancement of this church in knowledge and holiness; to 
give it a place in our affections, prayers and services above every organization of 
human origin; to sustain it's worship, ordinances discipline and doctrine; to 
contribute cheerfully and regularly, as God has prospered us, towards it's expenses, 
of the support of a faithful and evangelical ministry among us, the relief of the 
poor and the spread of the Gospel throughout the world. In case of difference of 
opinion in the church, we will cheerfully recognize the right of the majority to 
govern.

We also engage to maintain family and secret devotion; to study diligently the 
Word of God; to continually educate our children; to seek the salvation of our 
kindred and acquaintance; to walk circumspectly in the world; to be kind to those 
in our employ, and faithful in the service we promise others; endeavoring in the 
purity of heart and good will towards all men to exemplify and commend our holy 
faith.

We further engage to watch over, to pray for, to exhort and stir up each other 
unto every good word and work; to guard each other's reputation, not needlessly 
exposing the infirmities of others; to participate in each other's joys, and with 
tender sympathy bear one another's burdens and sorrows; to cultivate Christian 
courtesy; to be slow to give or take offense, but always ready for reconciliation, 
being mindful of the rules of the Savior in the eighteenth chapter of Matthew, to 
secure it without delay; and through life, amid evil report, and good report, to seek 
to live to the glory of God, who hath called us out of darkness into His marvelous 
light.

When we remove from this place, we engage as soon as possible to unite with 
some other church where we can carry out the spirit of this covenant and the 
principles of God's Word.

        error in the original writings, and they are the supreme and final authority for faith and life.

2. We believe in one God, Creator and Sustainer of the universe, Who is eternally existent in three persons —
        Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
                        
3. We believe in the Deity of Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, sinless life, His death to pay the penalty for everyone’s 
sins, His bodily resurrection, His exaltation at God’s right hand, and His personal, imminent, pretribulational and 
        pre-millennial return.
                        
4. We believe that all have sinned and are therefore guilty before God and are under His condemnation.
                        
5. We believe that all who by faith receive Jesus Christ are born again of the Holy Spirit, therefore children of God 
        and eternally saved, and that the Holy Spirit dwells within every believer to enlighten, guide, and enable the 
        believer in life, testimony, and service. We believe that God answers the prayers of His people and meets their 
        needs according to His purpose.
                        
6. We believe that God gives spiritual gifts to all believers for the building up of the body of Christ. However, the 
        miraculous sign-gifts of the Spirit, such as tongues and healings, were limited to the early church.
                        
7. We believe in the bodily resurrection of the just and unjust, the everlasting blessedness of the saved in Glory 
        and the everlasting conscious punishment of the lost in hell.
                        
8. We believe that all believers are called to a life of separation from all worldly and sinful practices and alliances.
                        
9. We believe that from the beginning with Adam and Eve, God ordained marriage as only between one man and 
        one woman. All sexual activity outside of this biblical definition of marriage, including homosexual practices, is in 
        direct contradiction to God’s Word and His intention for the institution of the home.""")

        week. We believe that Adam and Eve were the first man and woman and that all of mankind has descended 
        from them and has inherited a sin nature from their fall into sin, resulting in a cursed creation. We believe in a 
        personal Satan who led some of the angels to rebel, enticed Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, and continues to 
        oppose God’s program for human history. We believe in a worldwide flood which explains the disappearance of 
        certain species recorded in the fossil record, the subsequent development of mankind from Noah, and the 
        creation of language groups and nations from God’s intervention at the Tower of Babel. We believe that Satan’s 
        attempt to overthrow God is doomed to fail and that the Lake of Fire has been prepared as a place of eternal

Having been led, as we believe, by the Spirit of God to receive the Lord Jesus 
Christ as our Savior; and on the profession of our faith, having been baptized in the 
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, we do now in the 
presence of God, angels and this assembly, most solemnly and joyfully enter into 
covenant with one another, as one body in Christ.

We engage therefore, by the aid of the Holy Spirit, to walk together in Christian 
love; to strive for the advancement of this church in knowledge and holiness; to 
give it a place in our affections, prayers and services above every organization of 
human origin; to sustain it's worship, ordinances discipline and doctrine; to 
contribute cheerfully and regularly, as God has prospered us, towards it's expenses, 
of the support of a faithful and evangelical ministry among us, the relief of the 
poor and the spread of the Gospel throughout the world. In case of difference of 
opinion in the church, we will cheerfully recognize the right of the majority to 
govern.

We also engage to maintain family and secret devotion; to study diligently the 
Word of God; to continually educate our children; to seek the salvation of our 
kindred and acquaintance; to walk circumspectly in the world; to be kind to those 
in our employ, and faithful in the service we promise others; endeavoring in the 
purity of heart and good will towards all men to exemplify and commend our holy 
faith.

We further engage to watch over, to pray for, to exhort and stir up each other 
unto every good word and work; to guard each other's reputation, not needlessly 
exposing the infirmities of others; to participate in each other's joys, and with 
tender sympathy bear one another's burdens and sorrows; to cultivate Christian 
courtesy; to be slow to give or take offense, but always ready for reconciliation, 
being mindful of the rules of the Savior in the eighteenth chapter of Matthew, to 
secure it without delay; and through life, amid evil report, and good report, to seek 
to live to the glory of God, who hath called us out of darkness into His marvelous 
light.

When we remove from this place, we engage as soon as possible to unite with 
some other church where we can carry out the spirit of this covenant and the 
principles of God's Word.

SHEKINAH BLAZE OUTREACH INTERNATIONAL 
Shall be based upon and at all times and be consistent with the following creeds and
Beliefs:

1. We believe in the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments in their original writing as fully inspired of God and accept them as the supreme and final authority for faith and life.

2. We believe in one God, eternally existent in three Persons — Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

3. We believe that Jesus Christ was begotten of the Father, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary and is true God and true man.

4. We believe that God created man in His own image; that man sinned and thereby incurred the penalty of sin which is death, physically and spiritual; that all human beings inherit a sinful nature which issues (in the case of those who reach moral responsibility) in actual transgression involving personal guilt.

5. We believe that the LORD Jesus Christ died for our sins a substitutionary sacrifice according to the Scriptures and that all who believe in Him are justified on the grounds of His shed blood.

6. We believe in the bodily resurrection of the LORD Jesus, His ascension into heaven, and His present life as our High Priest and Advocate.

7. We believe in the personal return of the Lord Jesus Christ.

8. We believe that all who repent of their sin and receive the Lord Jesus Christ by faith are born again of the Holy Spirit and thereby become children of God.

9. We believe in baptism in Holy Spirit, empowering and equipping believers for services, with the accompanying service, with the accompanying supernatural gifts of the Spirit; and in fellowship with the Holy Spirit.

10. We believe in the divinely ordained ministries of Apostle, Prophets, Evangelist, Pastor and Teacher.

11. We believe in the resurrection of both the just and the unjust, the eternal blessedness of the redeemed, and the eternal banishment of those who have rejected the offer of salvation.

12. We believe that the one true church is the whole company of those who have been redeemed by Jesus Christ and regenerated by the Holy Spirit; that the local church on earth should take its character from this conception of the Church spiritual and therefore. That the new birth and personal confession of Christ are essential of Church membership.

13. We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ appointed Mo ordinances — Baptism in water and the Lord's Supper — to be observed as acts of obedience and as perpetual witnesses to the cardinal facts of the Christian faith; that Baptism is the immersion of the believe in water as a confession of identification with Christ in burial and resurrection and that the Lord's Supper is the partaking of the emblems symbolic of the Savior’s broken body and shed blood, in remembrance of His sacrificial death, till He comes.

14. We believe that divine healing was provided for in the Old Testament and is an integral part of the Gospel.

15. We regard to submission to authority, we believe in the principle of being in authority because you are under authority. As such, it is understood that church membership shall be subject to submission to authority in matters pertaining to church governance, doctrine and personal behaviour.

16. We believe the Bible teaches that without holiness no man can see the Lord. We believe in the doctrine of sanctification as a definite, yet progressive work of grace, commencing at the time of the new birth and continuing until the consummation of salvation.""")
